# allocators

In order to better understand how memory allocation works, I wrote this nifty tool which enables the user to visualize how the computer will allocate/free memory using a variety of patterns.

The memory-allocation program is written in **C**, and the actual rendering/visualization is written **Ruby** using the Ruby2D library.
