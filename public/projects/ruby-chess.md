# ruby-chess

Who doesn't love a good game of Chess?

I wrote this implementation of the classic game of Chess while learning **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP). It can handle board rotation, rendering piece icons, and input with Smith Notation. It detects rules for castling, checking, and of course, checkmate.

This implementation is written in **Ruby**.
