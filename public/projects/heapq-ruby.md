# heapq-ruby

I am always interested in learning about algorithms, whether it's something new I can add to my toolbelt, or perhaps a concept or idea that I can apply when designing my own algorithms.

This project is a library implementing the Heap algorithm/structure, which is used in some other sorting, pathfinding, and search algorithms.

It is written in **Ruby**, and the project was built using **Test-Driven Development**, making use of **rspec**.
