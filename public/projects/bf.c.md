# bf.c

The BF language is an experimental, minimalist programming language with a confusing syntax to the uninitiated. It only uses a total of eight possible characters/symbols to achieve full Turing-completeness.

This project is an interpreter for running BF code. The interpreter is written in **C**.

Additionally, I've written another interpreter for this language in **Ruby**. Check my GitHub to learn more!
