# asm6502

Some of the most popular early computers used the same CPU: the 6502. This project is an assembler for 6502 assembly code.

While modern computers cannot run 6502 bytecode natively, it can be run using additional software solutions: emulators and virtual machines. I'm in the process of writing an emulator for this CPU as well, so stay tuned!

The entire project is written in **C** for x86/64 systems, making use of **`libc`**.
